        <h2>Einstein Rings</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In the early 20th century, <a href="https://cn.bing.com/search?q=%20Albert%20finstein&qs=ds&form=QBRE" target="_blank">Albert finstein</a>  developed his general theory of relativity, which
        <br>implied that massive objects in the universe would bend light, He predicted that if one
        <br>object was directly behind another, it would create an "Einstein Ring", but he didn't think
        <br> we'd ever observe one.</p>
        <p>However, there are now hundreds of known gravitational lenses, some of which are Einstein
        <br>Rings. Here is a famous one, called the "Cosmic Horseshoe", observed by the <a href="https://cn.bing.com/search?q=+Hubble+Space+Telescepe&form=QBLH&sp=-1&lq=0&pq=&sc=0-0&qs=n&sk=&cvid=5EBB63093F664B37894565C78144F59E&ghsh=0&ghacc=0&ghpl=" target="_blank">Hubble Space 
        <br>Telescepe.</a></p>

        <P>Some interesting facts:</P>
        <ul>
        <li>The lens galaxy in the foreground is reddish, while the background galaxy is blueish</li>
        <li>The radius of the ring on the sky is about the same as a one dollar coin viewed from a
        <br>distance of 700 kilometres.</li>
        </ul>
