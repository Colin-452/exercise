        <h2>Einstein Cross</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The Einstein Cross (Q2237+030 or QSO 2237+0305) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens" target="_blank">gravitationally lensed quasar</a> 
        <br>that sits directly behind the centre of the galaxy ZW 2237+030, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huchra%27s_lens" target="_blank">Huchra's Lens.</a>
        <br>Four images of the same distant quasar (plus one in the centre, too dim to see) appear in the middle of the foreground galaxy due to strong gravitational lensing.</p>
        <p>his system was discovered by John Huchra and coworkers in 1985, although at the time they only detected that there was a quasar behind a galaxy based on differing redshifts and did not resolve the four separate images of the quasar.

        <P>Some interesting facts:</P>
        <ul>
        <li>The Einstein Cross can be found in Pegasus at 22h 40m 30.3s, +3° 21' 31″.</li>
        <li>The individual images are labelled A through D (i.e. QSO 2237+0305 A),
        <br>the lensing galaxy is sometimes referred to as QSO 2237+0305 G.</li>
