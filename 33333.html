        <h2>IC 434</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>IC 434 is a bright <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_nebula" target="_blank">emission nebula</a> in the equatorial constellation of Orion. It was discovered on February 1,
        <br>1786 by German-British astronomer William Herschel.
        <br>The nebula is located at a distance of approximately 1,260 ly (385 pc) from the Sun and spans the interior of a neutral hydrogen shell with an angular size of 2° * 4°. 
        <br>At that distance, the dimensions correspond to a projected size of 42 ly * 85 ly (13 pc * 26 pc).</p>
        <p>IC 434 is surrounded by a shell of neutral hydrogen gas with the identifier GS206-17+13. The primary driving energy behind this expanding shell was likely supplied by the blue supergiant Epsilon Orionis.
        <br>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsehead_Nebula" target="_blank">Horsehead Nebula </a>The Horsehead Nebula is a dark nebula that is silouetted against the diffuse background of IC 434. It is protruding from the Orion B molecular cloud, which is part of the Orion molecular cloud complex.</p>
